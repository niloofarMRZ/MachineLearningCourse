# MachineLearningCourse
In this course, the basic machine learning algorithms were taught.
These algorithms include topics such as: decision tree, Naive Bayes algorithm , Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Random Forest and so on.

Also, at the end of the course, several sessions were dedicated to teaching deep learning topics.

The description of the projects done in this course is as follows:

HW1)decision tree + prunning

HW2)bayes algorithm + Gaussian navie bayes + fold cross validation

HW3)logistic regression + gradient ascent + comparison with NB

HW4)soft SVM + non-linear SVM + RBF kernel + polynomial kernel

project) MLP neural network on MNIST dataset + learning curve + sigmoid and ReLu activators + adam and SGD optimizers
