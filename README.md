# MachineLearningCourse
In this course, the basic machine learning algorithms were taught.
These algorithms include topics such as: decision tree, Naive Bayes algorithm , Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-Means, Random Forest and so on .

Also, at the end of the course, several sessions were dedicated to teaching deep learning topics.

The description of the projects done in this course is as follows:
